## 🧠 Major Learnings

### 📌 Key Technologies Covered

- **Next.js**: Framework for building scalable React applications with file-based routing and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for efficient and responsive design.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience.
- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime for APIs that enables flexible, efficient data fetching.
- **API Integration**: Handling data from external or backend services using REST or GraphQL.
- **System Design & Analysis**: Designing scalable, efficient, and user-focused systems.

### ⚠️ Challenges & 💡 Solutions

| Challenge                           | Solution                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handling dynamic routing in Next.js | Leveraged `[slug].tsx` pages and `getStaticProps`/`getServerSideProps` functions            |
| Styling complexity in large UIs     | Adopted Tailwind utility classes and component abstraction                                  |
| API data inconsistencies            | Used TypeScript types and Zod schema validation                                             |
| Mobile responsiveness               | Utilized Tailwind's responsive utility classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)                        |
| Backend API integration             | Collaborated with backend learners, consumed their endpoints, and handled errors gracefully |
